# web-scraping-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with two different deliverables:
  1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles
  2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

In deliverable #2 we had to answer the following questions:
  1. How many months exist on Mars?
  2. How many Martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
  3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars?
  4. Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
  5. About how many Earth days exist in a Martian year?

We used the splinter and beautiful soup libraries of Python to work through this challenge.
